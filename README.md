# PyQGIS_2nd_edition

**Unleash QGIS with Python: a beginners course**, 2nd Edition, ISA/ULisboa, March-April 2022

Instructor: *Manuel Campagnolo, ISA/ULisboa*

In this repository, you can find:
- The scripts used in the course: each script (python script) has a name that matches the names below.
- A zip file `Input.zip` (that will be refered as the **Input folder** below) that contains all vectorial geographic data sets and tables that are used in the course 
- A zip file `Figures and other course documentation.zip` that contains figures and documents that complement the course contents below.

Notice: the local organization of files in you computer should be as described below for Windows (please adapt the paths for MasOS). Data are organized in sub-folders, to be just under an arbitrary "working folder" (e.g. C:\users\my_user\Documents\PyQGIS):
- input: input data sets for exercises (e.g. `C:\users\my_user\Documents\PyQGIS\input`): where input files should be stored
- scripts: where python scripts should go (e.g. `C:\users\my_user\Documents\PyQGIS\scripts`): where Python scripts should be stored
- temp: temporary folder for outputs (e.g. `C:\users\my_user\Documents\PyQGIS\temp`): where intermediate and output files should be written

## Session 1: First example; using processing and history to obtain commands for the script; using variables and file paths

* Input: Vector geografic data sets representing a road `RVFundamental.gpkg` and a protection area for wild fires `RPFGC_PPSM.gkpk`. See this map and the intended vegetation profile from Manual da Rede Prim√°ria.
* Problem: determine two road buffers: one interior buffer within distance D of the road; one exterior buffer to fill the rest of the protection area. Both buffers need to be contained within the protection area. Then, create a single data set containing both buffers with an attribute that takes value "interior" and "exterior". See operations diagram for the problem.

Try the following extensions of the problem: 
1. Use a variable for D instead of a fixed value; 
2. Use variables for the folder and file names; 
3. Add output to interface as a QGIS layer; 
4. Clear QGIS layers; 
5. Solve the more realistic problem with 3 regions instead of 2.

   - See "Using processing algorithms from the console" from QGIS documentation
   - The QgsProject class from QGIS documentation

## Session 2: Create layers in memory; Export a layer to file; Symbology; Renderer; Change symbol in Single Symbol (color, opacity, stroke width); Create Categorized legend; List attribute names for the layer (access attribute table).

Proposed exercise: Write a new solution for the problem of session 1 using temporary layers: see script `session_1_v4_use_temporary_outputs.py`

Change symbology for the resulting layer:
  - Input data: The layer that is the input of this new problem can be found in the Input folder
  - The scripts can be found in the scripts folder: `session_2_v1_single_symbol_legend.py` and `session_2_v2_graduated_legend.py`

## Session 3:
### Part 1: Use dictionary to define legend: create function with arguments layer, legend (a dictionary) and an attribute (the attribute name on which the legend is based)

* Input: As before, the layer that is the input for this  problem `IntExt_20.gpkg` can be found in the Input folder
* Scripts: 
```
session_2_v3_graduated_legend_with dictionary.py
session_2_v4_define_function_for_legend_with_dictionary_as_argument.py
session_2_v5_load_auxiliary_functions.py # For keeping auxiliary functions in separate file
```
### Part 2: Re-use the auxiliary functions above for a new data set (NUTS)

The input data is the NUTS (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) map for Europe. The script allows to choose the NUTS level that one wants to draw. All features with the same country name will be represented with the same color in the legend. Colors are random, but the user can choose the range of RGB to create lighter or darker colors.

* Input: NUTS map from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts. The shapefile files are also available in  the Input folder.
* Scripts in in the scripts folder: `session_3_v1_NUTS_create_dictionary_apply_legend_function.py`. Notice: There is a challenge at the end of the script, which is to  define a new function that creates the dictionary and the symbology

### Part 3: Re-write the script `session_1_v4_use_temporary_outputs.py`

Simplify the script `session_1_v4_use_temporary_outputs.py` by creating new functions `my_clean_project`, `my_add_vector_layer`, `my_processing_run`, `my_remove_layer` in `auxiliary_functions.py`. At the end, you should have a new script similar to `session_1_v6_simplify_s1v4_by_calling_functions.py`, which is more compact than `session_1_v4_use_temporary_outputs.py`.

Exercise suggestion: use functions `my_add_vector_layer`, `my_processing_run` to replace the code below in script `session_3_v1_NUTS_create_dictionary_apply_legend_function.py` and get a more compact script.

```         
# read data and create layer
mylayer=QgsVectorLayer(fn_nuts,"", "ogr")
mylayer.setName(ln_nuts)
myproject.addMapLayer(mylayer)

# select only feature for the chosen NUTS_level
mylayer=processing.run("native:extractbyattribute", 
{'INPUT':ln_nuts,
'FIELD':nuts_level_attrib,
'OPERATOR':0,
'VALUE':nuts_level_value,
'OUTPUT':QgsProcessing.TEMPORARY_OUTPUT})['OUTPUT']

mylabel=ln_nuts+'_'+str(nuts_level_value)
mylayer.setName(mylabel)
myproject.addMapLayer(mylayer)
```

## Session 4: Converting blocks of code into functions; modularity.  Regular expressions. Message boxes in PyQGIS.

### Part 1: Function to build a dictionary and another function to apply that dictionary to create a graduated symbology for the NUTS data set. Using a matplotlib colormap

* Input: NUTS map from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts. The shapefile files are also available in  the Input folder.
* Scripts:
   - For the graduated legend for the NUTS units' area:  
```
session_4_v1_NUTS_graduated_legend_color_ramp_from_matplotlib_no_dict.py
session_4_v2_NUTS_graduated_legend_color_ramp_from_matplotlib_with_dict.py
session_4_v3_NUTS_graduated_legend_color_ramp_from_matplotlib_with_functions.py
auxiliary_functions.py
```

### Part 2:  Miscelaneous: scripts to search strings (os module and regular expressions: re module), interact with user using MessageBox to remove files, create scatter plot with matplotlib

* Scripts:
```
search_string_in_files.py
basic_os_remove_files_message_boxes.py
basic_example_matplotlib.py
```

Exercise suggestions:
* (easy) create dictionary for the NUTS data set to define a graduated legend with 4 classes and respective labels that you choose "by hand". Then, call function `create_graduated_legend` (in `auxiliary_functions.py`) to create the legend.
* (more complex) Create a new function, in alternative to `create_graduated_legend_dict`, but with the same arguments `values,colormap,myopacity` that uses Sturges rule to determine the approximate number of classes to consider and define classes of equal amplitude for the legend. The output of this new function should be a dictionary (analogous to the output of `create_graduated_legend_dict`). Solution of the exercise: check function `create_sturges_graduated_legend_dict` in `auxiliary_functions.py`

## Session 5: Dialog boxes to interact with the user; Read simple tables (csv, txt);  Iterate through features; Create new attributes (aka fields); Compute new attributes; Join by attribute

Proposed exercise: create a map that represents milk production for Portugal.

* Script: `session_5_v1_INE_read_csv_file_join_layers_by_attributes.py` has the following inputs and output:
  - Input: CAOP; Milk production table; type of milk prodution (cow, goat, or sheep) to be asked to the user;
  - Output: a QGIS layer that represents milk production of that type for the "concelhos" (second administrative level)  of Portugal with an adequate legend.
* Other scripts:
```
basic_examples_QInputDialog_and_QMessageBox.py
auxiliary_functions.py
```
* Data sets: [CAOP map (Portuguese administrative units)](https://www.dgterritorio.gov.pt/cartografia/cartografia-tematica/caop), Milk production table from INE (Portuguese official statistics institute) , available in the Input folder


Extra exercise suggestion:
* Create a script that reads the NUTS data set and confirms that for all features, the attribute `LEVL_CODE` is the length of the string in attribute `NUTS_ID` plus 2. Use iterator over `mylayer.getFeatures()` to check that this is true for all features.


## Session 6: Access data sets with WFS protocol; Vector layer geometry; Create a layer from scratch using wkt strings (well known text); Determine geometry of layers; Edit coordinates of vertices and create new layer.

* Documents. Description of geometry of features and wkt strings: singlepart and multipart, available in `Figures and other course documentation.zip`
* Data:
   - RNAP (protected areas in Portugal) to access with WFS (but the file is also available in the Input folder)
   - `Streams.gpkg` in Input folder to test result of assignment
* Scripts:
```
session_6_read_WFS_from_uri_check_modify_encoding_QInputDialog_Export_as_local_file.py
session_6_1_small_example_create layer with one point feature
session_6_2_RNAP_read_WFS_from_uri_check_modify_encoding_QInputDialog_Export_as_local_file.py
session_6_3_b_RNAP_vector_determine_geometry.py
session_6_3_c_RNAP_vector_layer_geometry_access_vertices_with_accessor_function.py
session_6_4_RNAP_vector_layer_change_vertices_coordinates.py
auxiliary_functions.py
```

Exercise suggestion: 
* Adapt the function `round_vertices_coordinates_multipolygon` (which is in the current version of auxiliary_functions.py) and is called from the script `session_6_4_RNAP_vector_layer_change_vertices_coordinates.py` to create a new function, say, `round_vertices_coordinates_multilinestring` which has as input a MultiLineString layer. You can test it using a data set in `inputs` called `Streams.gpkg`.

## Session 7: Regular expressions and file management to search for the location of a given string among all files in a folder; Vector layer geometry to  and fix validity of layers; Geopackage -- create and populate geopackage; Read layers from geopackage; Query Geopackage with SQL

### Part 1 (regular expressions)

* Script `my_index_search_strings_in_files_regex.py`

### Part 2 (fix geometries)

* Script `session_6_3_a_vector_layer_clone_check_and_fix_features_validity.py`
* Input:  `landUse_invalid_features.gpkg`: data set with invalid features

### Part 3 (SQL)
   
* Input: Geopackage (database) `CascaisZoning.gpkg`
* Scripts
```
session_7-a_create_geopackage_from_files.py
session_7_b_Cascais_simple_example_of_SQL_query_over_geopackage.py
auxiliary_functions.py
```

## Session 8: SQL queries within Python script; Converting SQL query result into a new vector layer; Adding new layer to existing geopackage; Solving a zoning problem over Cascais

* Scripts
```
session_8_a_v1_Cascais_first_examples_SQL_queries_.py
session_8_a_v2_Cascais_first_examples_SQL_queries_with_function.py
session_8_b_Cascais_exaamples_SQL_queries_ST_intersect_ORDER_BY.py
session_8_c_Cascais_example_ST_buffer_create_new_layer_add_layer_to_geopackage.py
auxiliary_functions.py
 ```
 
* Documents in `Figures and other course documentation.zip`: Spatial Analysis Problem Cascais; Cascais Zoning Diagram Soil Productivity : diagram describing SQL query; Cascais Zoning Diagram Road Buffer: diagram describing SQL query

Proposed exercise: 
* Cascais Zoning Problem. The problem is described in `Spatial Analysis Problem Cascais.docx` in `Figures and other course documentation.zip`. The goal is to solve the Zoning problem for Cascais using the information in the `CascaisZoning.gpkg` geopackage available in the Input folder

Extra exercises:
* Look at the script `session_1_v6_simplify_s1v4_by_calling_functions.py` to see how you can use the functions that are already defined to run tools of processing toolbox and make your code shorter and clearer;
* First run the function you need in the QGIS interface from Processing toolbox, and then look at "History" and copy the script that is there and adapt it to look something like this -- the functions you need are in `auxiliary_functions.py`:
```
dict_params={'OVERLAY':'my overlay layer name'}
mylayer=my_processing_run("native:clip",'my input layer name',dict_params,'my output layer name')
```
3. You can remove layers you don't need anymore with `my_remove_layer('name_of_the_layer_to_be_removed')`
4. You should be able to solve the whole problem just with operations from the Processing toolbox, but you can use other options if you want
5. Since the data are all in a geopackage, to open simple tables you don't need to go through the more complicated details needed to open a csv or txt file: you just load the layer from the geopackage as discussed in the script `session_7_a_create_geopackage_from_files.py`

## Session 9: A resolution for the Cascais Zoning problem just using operations from the processing Toolbox; New script replacing some operations by one SQL query; Raster data

### Installing QGIS through OSGeo4W (windows); using OSGeo4W shell to install Python packages:

1. Downloading and installing QGIS (instructions for installing QGIS via the OSGeo4W distribution manager). [https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog489/node/2294]
  - 1st: go to [https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html] and download OSGeo4W Network installer (Window users)
  - 2nd: execute the downloaded file osgeo4w-setup.exe (follow instructions in [https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog489/node/2294]): this will take some time... Files will be typically installed in C:\OSGeo4W (Note: to install packages that require dependencies which are hard to install later in the shell, choose advanced installation and choose the packages you want to install, e.g. python3-geopandas; python3-fiona; can also install useful packages like rasterio; check geowombat, scipy, sklearn, etc). Important files:
    - C:\OSGeo4W\OSGeo4W.bat - This opens the OSGeo4W shell that can be used for executing python scripts from the command line.
    - C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qgis-ltr-bin.exe - This is the main QGIS executable that you need to run for starting QGIS 3.
    - Obs: we will execute scripts directly in QGIS, so the OSGeo4W shell (windows key+ OSGeo4W shell) will only be needed to install Python packages (see below).
2. Anyway, to run the Python interpreter from the OSGeo4W shell one should execute python-qgis-ltr  -- leave with "quit()".
  - Installing pip (most likely not necessary since it should be included in the above installation): https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
  - Installing a python package that is not included in OSGeo4W: Exemple: Install package sklearn (package for Data Science not included in OSGeo4W): 
    - 1st: open OSGeo4W shell (window key+ osgeo4w shell);  
    - 2nd: execute "python -m pip install --user sklearn" in OSGeo4W shell; 
    - 3rd: in the python console of QGIS do "import sklearn" to verify that it is loaded correctly (i.e. there is no error message)
    - Example: install package haversine (distances over the sphere).
